# Chapter 9 - Laplace Transform

[toc]

## What is Laplace Transform

The Laplace Transform (LT) is the **generalization** of the Fourier Transform to **include general complex exponential signals** of the form
$$
e^{st}=e^{(\sigma+j\omega)t}=e^{\sigma t}e^{j\omega t}
$$
We can generalize because $e^{st}$ also follows:
$$
e^{st} \xrightarrow{\tau} H(s)e^{st}=e^{st}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(\tau)e^{-s\tau}d\tau
$$
üòçFor **intuitive understanding of Laplace Transform**, you can refer to the following video, which has a lot of 3D plot visualizations to help you better understand!üòç

### Bilateral Laplace Transform

In this course, we only concern **Bilateral Laplace Transform**.

Bilateral Laplace Transform means that the integral starts from negative infinity to positive infinity. 

The formula is 
$$
X(s)=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x(t)e^{-st}dt\\
x(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi j}\int^{\sigma+j\infty}_{\sigma-j\infty}X(s)e^{st}ds\\
s=\sigma+j\omega
$$
LT pairs can be denoted as:
$$
x(t)\leftrightarrow X(s)
$$

Typically, you should **RARELY** use the above 2 equations during the exam. Instead, please use common LT pairs on the exam paper to simplify the calculation.

### Relationship between Laplace Transform & Fourier Transform

We can derive the following relationship:
$$
X(s)|_{s=j\omega}=\mathcal{F}\{x(t)\}\\
$$

$$
X(s)=\mathcal{F}\{x(t)e^{-\sigma t}\},  \text{where }s=\sigma+j\omega
$$

**Summary**:

Fourier Transform is a **slice** of Laplace transform.

### Region of Convergence (ROC)

#### Concept

ROC is **the set of values of s** on the complex plane for which the **bilateral Laplace transform is guaranteed to exist/converge**. That is, 
$$
ROC=\{s\in C:\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}|x(t)|e^{-real\{s\}t}dt< \infty \}
$$
To define **a pair of Laplace Transform**, you **have to** specify its **ROC**! 


#### Plot

Often we display the ROC of a signal using the **complex s-plane** as shown in the following Ô¨Ågures.

<img src="C:\Users\86151\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20240417212112121.png" alt="image-20240417212112121" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- The horizontal axis is called $\sigma$ axis, and the vertical axis is called $j\omega$ axis.
- The shaded region indicates ROC.
- Dotted lines is used to indicate boundaries if ROC doesn‚Äôt include its edges.
- **If the shaded region includes the $j\omega$ axis, then the FT of the signal exists.**



#### Poles and Zeros for Rational Laplace Transform

If the Laplace transform of a signal $x(t)$, $X(s)$, has the form:

$$
X(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = \frac{\sum_{m=0}^{M} b_m s^m}{\sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n s^n} = G \frac{\prod_{k=1}^{M} (s - z_k)}{\prod_{k=1}^{N} (s - p_k)}
$$

- **Zeros**: \($z_1$,$z_2$, $\ldots$, $z_M$), sometimes infinity
- **Poles**: ( $p_1$, $p_2$, $\ldots$, $p_N$\), sometimes infinity
- **Gain**: G = $\frac{b_M}{a_N}$

**Questions:**

1. **What do zeros & poles mean?** 

   Let $z_1$ be zero, and $p_1$ be pole, we can obtain
   $$
   X(z_1)=0\\
   X(p_1)=\infty
   $$

2. **How to judge zeros/poles at $\infty$**?

   If $lim_{s\rightarrow\infty}H(s)=0$, there is a zero at infinity. 

   If $lim_{s\rightarrow\infty}H(s)\rightarrow \infty$, there is a pole at infinity. 

##### Pole-zero plot

Using ‚Äôo‚Äô to represent zeros, using ‚ÄôX‚Äô to represent poles

#### Property of ROC

This part is used to judge the ROC of Laplace Transform. 

- The ROC of $X(s)$ consists of **stripe-shaped** regions parallel to the $j\omega$ axis in the s plane.
- The ROC of rational LT does not contain any poles.
- If $x(t)$ has a Ô¨Ånite duration and is absolutely integrable, the ROC is the whole s plane.
- If $x(t)$ is **right sided** (remaining zeros when $t < t_0$), and if the line $Re\{s\} = \sigma_0$ is in the ROC, then all values of $s$ whose $Re\{s\} > \sigma_0$ will also be in the ROC.
- If $x(t)$ is **left sided**, and if the line $Re\{s\} = \sigma_0$ is in the ROC, then all values of s whose $Re\{s\} < \sigma_0$ will also be in the ROC.
- If $x(t)$ is **two sided**, and if the line $Re\{s\} = \sigma_0$ is in the ROC, then the ROC is composed of a stripe-shaped region including the line $Re\{s\} = \sigma_0$ on the s plane.
- If $X(s)$ is rational, its ROC is constrained by the poles or extents to inÔ¨Ånity.
- If $X(s)$ is rational, and if $x(t)$‚Äã is right sided, the ROC is on the right of the rightest pole. 
- If $X(s)$ is rational and left sided, its ROC is on the left of the leftest pole.



You can refer to this video by Prof. Oppenheim for detailed explanation, which derive from scratch: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1SB4y1C7yx?p=20&vd_source=0be2819c805c6da41df6967754921b05 



#### ROC and System Properties

The Laplace transform $H(s)$ of a system‚Äôs impulse response $h(t)$ is called its system function.

- Stability ‚áî $j\omega$ axis in ROC ‚áî $h(t)$ absolutely integrable
- Causality ‚áî $h(t)$ is a right-sided signal ‚áî ROC of the system function H(s) is the right-half plane (RHP) to the right of the rightmost pole.
- Stability and Causality ‚áî All of its poles lie strictly within the LHP (left-half of the s-plane).
- ***CAUTION***: Consider poles at ¬±$\infty$! e.g. $H(s) = s$ has a pole at s = $\infty$.
- All improper systems are unstable!
- **A diffeq system is stable** iff all roots of its characteristic polynomial are in the left half plane.



#### Geometric Properties of FT from pole-zero plot

Given the pole-zero plot corresponding to the transfer function $H(s)$  of an LTI system, we can sketch the magnitude response $|H(\omega)|$  and phase response $\angle H(\omega)$:

$$
H(\omega) = G \frac{(j\omega - z_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (j\omega - z_m)}{(j\omega - p_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (j\omega - p_n)}
$$
Magnitude response:

$$
|H(\omega)| = G \frac{|j\omega - z_1| \cdot \ldots \cdot |j\omega - z_m|}{|j\omega - p_1| \cdot \ldots \cdot |j\omega - p_n|}
$$
Phase response:

$$
\angle H(\omega) = \angle G + \angle(j\omega - z_1) + \ldots + \angle(j\omega - z_m) - \angle(j\omega - p_1) - \ldots - \angle(j\omega - p_n)
$$

#### ‚ú®Inverse Laplace Transform

**Requirement**: Given rational $X(s)$ and **ROC**, we are required to invert it to Ô¨Ånd signal $x(t)$.

**Steps**:

- Decompose $X(s)$ into **the sum of atomic expressions** by doing **PFE**.

- For each expression, Ô¨Ånd ROC. Select the one including the ROC of LT.

- For each expression, use LT table and LT properties to get the result. Then sum them up.

- ***CAUTION***: If the ROC is not given explicitly, discuss all the situations!!! 

There are cases that given the pole-zero plot and DC value, and ask you to Ô¨Ånd x(t). In this case, you need to Ô¨Ånd the gain G with certain points.


##### Exercise

The system function of a causal LTI system is

$$

$$
Determine and sketch the response \( $y(t)$ \) when the input is

$$
e^{-|t|}, \quad -\infty < t < \infty
$$
*Hint:* You can use $e^{-|t|}=e^{-t}u(t)+e^{t}u(-t)$



**Answer:**

















### ‚ú®Differential Equation

Solve **algebraic expression** by Linear Constant Coefficient Differential Equation.

2. Draw the block diagram according to $H(s)$.

- $m = n$: Just apply the method.

- $m < n$: e.g. $H(s) = \frac{1}{s^2+3s+2}$, we just Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åll all the item in the upper to make the upper and lower part are at the same order. Finally **remove the branch** with zero coeÔ¨Écient.

- $m > n$: e.g. $H(s) = s$. It has poles at $s = \infty$, which makes the system improper (All rational but improper systems are unstable!!), thus **won‚Äôt appear in real cases**.



## Notes

**Before the exam: **

1. **Review all the quizzes! **
1. Review homework answers.
1. Gain proficiency in calculation (PFE, Common Laplace Transform, differential equation, etc. ).

**During the exam: **
